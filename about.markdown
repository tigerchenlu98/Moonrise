<h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome!</h1>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">My name is Tiger and I study planetary motion.</h2>

Over the past three decades, the search for planets around other stars has unveiled an astonishing diversity of bizarre worlds that have seriously challenged our best theories of planet formation. My research concerns the formation of these strange systems, and I approach this problem with a combination of analytic theory and numerical simulations.

I'm interested in a lot of things. If it involves dynamics, I can probably be convinced to like it! Here are a few things I'm thinking about at the moment, and do feel to reach out if any of these excite you!

-   Self-consistent treatment of dynamics with planetary structure evolution
-   Breaking the chains
-   Dynamical outcomes of planet-planet scattering
-   The interior structures of exoplanets, and how we can measure them
-   Numerical methods that can speed up N-Body simulations
-   3D Architectures

I'm presently

- a Flatiron Research Fellow at the Flatiron Institute's <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/">Center for Computational Astrophysics</a>
- an affiliated postdoc in the <a href="http://www.astro.yale.edu/malenarice/team.html">Rice Research Group</a>

Prior to my current position, I recently received my Ph.D. from Yale University in 2025 where I was advised by [Gregory Laughlin](https://astronomy.yale.edu/people/gregory-laughlin) and [Malena Rice](http://www.astro.yale.edu/malenarice). My dissertation was titled [<i>Planets are not Points: the Profound Effect of Planetary Structure on Exoplanet System Architectures</i>](Lu_Dissertation.pdf). I am told the Acknowledgements are quite wholesome, if you're interested in reading about the many wonderful people who've been important to my career. You can also find a video of my defense [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyJ-rP_MWtk). Prior to <em>that</em> I received my B.S. in Astrophysics from Caltech in 2020.

I grew up in Shanghai, China and even after all this time I believe it to be the greatest city in the world. When I'm not thinking about planets I enjoy, in no particular order: boba, running, stuffed animals, the ocean, the outfits worn by Uniqlo mannequins, national parks and kombucha. on. tap.

Pictured here are a few research-related highlights over the years that make me happy!
