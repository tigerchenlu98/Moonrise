Here youâ€™ll find fun, bite-sized overviews of the key directions in my research. I <b>strongly</b> believe the coolest, most impactful science in the world is utterly useless if you can't explain it. In that vein I've done my best to keep this page at a level appropriate for the general public. If you're an astronomer, or if you're just generally interested in the detailed methodology behind any of these works, I've linked all the associated papers as well. I am also very happy for any excuse to chat about my research so do not hesitate to reach out!

Here is a <a class="btn" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/w1612yBmSPmrRy2smeA3ow"> button </a> leading to an ADS library that includes all of my publications.
