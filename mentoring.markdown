Mentoring has been one of the most rewarding parts of my career, and I feel fortunate to have worked with some exceptionally talented students over the years. I often say that I've never had a student who wasn't a better scientist than myself, and I'm genuinely only ~15% joking. On this page you'll find brief bios of the students I've directly supervised.

    <p>
      Yurou (Nina) Liu is senior undergraduate at Yale University studying Physics (Intensive) and Computer Science, with a focus on exoplanetary science. She is researching exoplanet dynamics and substellar atmospheres. Beyond astrophysics research, she has designed her computer science major around computer graphics and vision.
